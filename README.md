# PHP note: Roman Hossain Shaon

# Abstract: class is a class that has at least one abstract method.

- Abstract classes in PHP can be used to improve security by 
  promoting code organization, encapsulation, and abstraction. 

- Importantnote primary purpose of abstract classes 
  is not security but rather code structure and design.

`It shows only useful information, remaining are hidden form the end user`


- Abstract classes can contribute to loose coupling in PHP 
  by allowing you to define and use abstractions without relying on concrete implementations. 

- Loose coupling refers to reducing the dependencies between different parts of a system, 
  making it more modular and easier to maintain.


* Explicitly: Code Readability, Code Organization, Encapsulation, Code Reusability, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Type Hinting, Dependency Injection,        
              Documentation, Easier Maintenance

   - OOP PHP explicit code provides several benefits 
   - contributing to better code organization

   - readability: 
      classes, methods, and properties makes your code more readable. 
      developers understand the purpose and functionality of each component

   - maintainability:
   - Encapsulation:
        public, private, protected allows you to controle
        the visibility of properties and methods
